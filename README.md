# Music Library Profiler

* Compiles information about your music library--namely BPM and the pitch class profile.
* Allows you to enter a song and find similar ones in your local library.

## Description

Blahhh blahhh blahhh

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Install the listed requirements in requirements.txt
* I haven't tested on any OS other than Ubuntu 24.02 so no guarantees it works anywhere else yet.

### Installing

* Erm just download it.

### Executing program

* Erm just run it?

## Help

No known issues because I'm perfect.

## For Developers

To export the program as an executable, use:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=assets/icon.png main.py
```

Use Qt Designer if you wanna make it look pretty (pyqt6-tools). As of 9/15/25, it won't work on Python 3.11 so I haven't used it yet.
